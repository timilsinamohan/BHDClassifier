###Prerequisites##
RESCAL: https://github.com/mnick/rescal.py

#####################################################################

(a) CKM_Physicans.py

(1) By default this code uses Rescal Tensor Embedding with Boundary Heat Diffusion. 
(2) To change other label propagation algorithm for example heat diffusion change this line in the code:
	Disable
	#score,label_pred = get_bhd_score(graph,train_nodes,labels)

	Enable
	score,label_pred = get_heat_score(graph,train_nodes,labels)

(3) To change the embedding for example Rescal to Node2vec change this line in the code:
	Disable
	#graph_embeddings = get_tensor_embeddings()

	Enable
	graph_embeddings = get_node2vec_embeddings()



(b) Leskovec_NG_Collab.py
 Same as CKM_Physicans.py

(c) multi_layer_benchmark.py
(1) By default this code uses Rescal Tensor Embedding with Boundary Heat Diffusion for a ACM data.
(2) To change the data change this line 
	 data_src = "ACM" to 
	 data_src = "DBLP" or
	 data_src = "IMDB"

For embeddings and label propagation it is same as "CKM_physicians.py" file
